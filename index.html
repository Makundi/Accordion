                    You are required to create an accordion component that displays a list of questions or headings.
                    When a
                    user clicks on a question, its corresponding answer or content section will expand while collapsing
                    any
                    previously opened section. This allows only one section to be open at a time, keeping the UI clean
                    and
                    organized.
